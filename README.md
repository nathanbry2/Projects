## Real Estate Data projects exploratory analysis and mapping

Following my internship at [Proprioo](https://www.proprioo.fr/), a French startup reinventing real estate with digital tools where I set-up the Data department, I developed a great interest in real estate Data. In mid-2019 the French Ministry of Economy has made public the notarial bases of the last 6 years (2014 to 2019). What are notarial bases? These are files listing all the real estate transactions throughout France, whether they concern land, commercial premises, apartments, houses or other types of properties. These databases thus include a large amount of information related to these transactions, the most important being the sale price, the date of sale, the different surfaces of the property (habitable surface, surface of a possible garden, surface of the cellars, etc.) and the address (in addition to the longitude and latitude) of the property.
Notarial bases can be downloaded [here](https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/datasets/5c4ae55a634f4117716d5656/)

Following this release I started several real estate projects using these data.

### Mapping

After a long data cleaning work of all Paris transactions (+100 000) contained in the notarial bases, I aggregated these transactions by [pluscode system](https://plus.codes/) developed by Google in order to create "neighborhoods" of around 75000m² with aggregated data in order to have an evolution of Paris real estate price and dynamism. After cleaning and aggregating data, I used Google Maps to plot these neighborhoods and create interactive maps containing all the Data.

- [Paris Map 1](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1bYKrzYddpg0RCIuHa554BcsgRQOnFXPc&usp=sharing) showing **the average m² price** for all Paris neighborhoods on a small and precise scale and giving you other information (number of transactions per year, average area, average price growth year after year, ...) for each neighborhood

- [Paris Map 2](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1b_0M5x9MTc8AH3XkYjj8f7i3TtrWi5X1&usp=sharing) showing **the average m² price growth** for all Paris neighborhoods on a small and precise scale and giving you other information (number of transactions per year, average price per m², average area, average price growth year after year, ...) for each neighborhood

### Article redaction

- Redaction of an [article](https://www.proprioo.fr/blog/dynamiques-quartiers-parisiens/) for Proprioo's blog [Parages](https://www.proprioo.fr/blog/) in French about Paris real estate price and dynamism trends after long analyses of the Paris notarial bases (containing all real estate transactions from 2015 to 2018)

## Football Data Analysis Project

Data Analysis project done with **Python** and using several Data Science libraries (**Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, seaborn**) in order to get valuable insights from several football datasets and produce nice plots (including interesting **heatmaps**). Datasets have be collected by [Wyscout](https://wyscout.com/) and can be downloaded [here](https://figshare.com/collections/Soccer_match_event_dataset/4415000).
